I’m a PhD researcher at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/isdo/staff/samed-bayer/), advised by Prof. Ingo Weber. I work on Generative AI to automate and accelerate scientific discovery, with a focus on AI agents, knowledge representation/discovery, and information retrieval. I build and evaluate systems that turn LLMs into reliable research partners.

I completed my M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering at TUM and my B.Sc. at Boğaziçi University. I previously interned at Siemens, Bosch, and several AI startups.

I enjoy mentoring students and collaborating with excellent researchers. If you're interested in discussing my work, I’d be happy to chat.

## Research Interests

- Generative AI and its applications in research workflows
- AI-assisted information retrieval, RAG, knowledge discovery and synthesis
- Human-AI co-creation interfaces and workflows
- AI Agents for automated reasoning and interaction
