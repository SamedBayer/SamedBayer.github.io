I’m a PhD researcher at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/isdo/staff/samed-bayer/) advised by Prof. Ingo Weber. I work on Generative AI for automating and accelerating scientific discovery, focusing on AI Agents, Knowledge Representation/Discovery and Information Retrieval. I build/evaluate systems that turn LLMs into reliable research partners.

I completed my M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering at TUM and my B.Sc. at Boğaziçi University. I previously interned at Siemens, Boshc and several AI startups. 

I enjoy mentoring students and collaborating with excellent researchers. If you are interested in discussing my work, I am happy to chat.


## Research Interests

- Generative AI and its applications in research workflows
- AI-assisted information retrieval, RAG, knowledge discovery and synthesis
- Human-AI co-creation interfaces and workflows
- AI Agents for automated reasoning and interaction
